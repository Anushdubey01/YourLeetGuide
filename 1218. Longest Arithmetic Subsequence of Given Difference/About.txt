The given program aims to find the length of the longest subsequence in an array where the difference between consecutive elements is equal to a given value 'diff'. Here's the breakdown of the intuition, approach, and complexity of the program:

Intuition:
To find the longest subsequence with the given difference, we can iterate over the array and keep track of the length of the subsequence ending at each element. We update this length using a HashMap, where the key represents the current element and the value represents the length of the subsequence ending at that element.

Approach:
1. Initialize the variable 'answer' to 0, which will store the length of the longest subsequence.
2. Create a HashMap called 'lengthAt' to store the length of subsequences ending at each element.
3. Iterate over each element 'a' in the given array 'arr'.
4. For each 'a', compute the length of the subsequence ending at 'a' by adding 1 to the length of the subsequence ending at 'a - diff'. Use the 'getOrDefault' method of the HashMap to handle the case when 'a - diff' is not present in the HashMap.
5. Update the 'answer' variable to store the maximum length encountered so far.
6. Return the 'answer' as the length of the longest subsequence.

Complexity:
The time complexity of this program is O(N), where N is the length of the input array 'arr'. This is because we iterate over each element of the array once.
The space complexity is also O(N) because we use a HashMap to store the length of subsequences ending at each element. In the worst case, when all elements are unique, the HashMap will contain N key-value pairs.
