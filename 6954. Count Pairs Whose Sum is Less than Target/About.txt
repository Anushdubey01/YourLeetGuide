**Intuition:**

The given program aims to count the number of pairs of integers in a list (`nums`) such that the sum of each pair is less than a specified target value.

**Approach:**

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the count of valid pairs. Start it at 0.

2. Iterate through the list `nums` using two nested loops, where `i` represents the index of the first element in the pair, and `j` represents the index of the second element in the pair.

3. For each pair of indices `(i, j)` (where `i < j`), calculate the sum of the elements at these indices, `pairSum = nums.get(i) + nums.get(j)`.

4. Check if `pairSum` is less than the target value. If it is, increment the `count` variable because this pair contributes to the count of pairs whose sum is less than the target.

5. Continue iterating through all possible pairs.

6. After both loops complete, return the final value of the `count` variable, which represents the count of pairs satisfying the condition.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** The program uses two nested loops to iterate through all pairs of elements in the `nums` list. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of elements in the list `nums`.

- **Space Complexity:** The program uses a constant amount of additional space for variables, so the space complexity is O(1), which means it does not depend on the size of the input list.
