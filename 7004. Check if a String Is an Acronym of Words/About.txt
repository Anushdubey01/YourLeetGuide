Intuition -
The program aims to determine whether a given string s is an acronym for a list of words provided as input. An acronym is typically formed by taking the first letter of each word in a phrase and combining them to create a new string. The program checks if the characters in s match the first characters of the words in the list, one-to-one.

Approach -
Check if the length of s is equal to the number of words in the list. If not, return false because the length mismatch implies that s cannot be an acronym for the given list of words.

Iterate through the list of words and compare the first character of each word with the corresponding character in s.

If at any point, the characters do not match, return false immediately, as this means s cannot be an acronym.

If all characters match for all words, return true, indicating that s is indeed an acronym for the given list of words.

Complexity -
Time Complexity:

Checking the length of s and the number of words in the list takes O(1) time.
The loop that iterates through the list of words and compares characters has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of words in the list.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).
Space Complexity:

The program uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. It only creates a few variables to store characters and indices.
Thus, the space complexity is O(1).
