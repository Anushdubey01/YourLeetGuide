# Intuition - 
The problem aims to find the maximum score of a sequence of operations performed on a list of numbers. Each operation involves raising a number to a power based on its properties, and the total score is calculated from the products of these powered numbers. The goal is to determine the maximum achievable score.

# Approach -
1. The code defines two helper functions: `calculateScore` and `calculatePower`, to calculate the score of a number and the power of a number respectively.
2. The `maximumScore` function starts by initializing a priority queue (`priorityQueue`) and a list of lists (`list`). The priority queue will be used to store numbers with their corresponding scores, and the list will store the numbers and their calculated scores.
3. The input list of numbers (`nums`) is iterated over to calculate their scores and store the data in both the priority queue and the list of lists.
4. The main loop starts, which aims to calculate the maximum score using the highest-scoring numbers.
5. In each iteration, the code dequeues the number with the highest score from the priority queue (`currentList`).
6. It then identifies the indices to the right and left of the current number (`currentIndex`) where operations can be performed while adhering to the rules mentioned.
7. The number of operations (`realOperations`) is calculated based on the possible range of indices.
8. The code calculates the result using the `calculatePower` function and updates the result variable accordingly.
9. The number of remaining operations (`k`) is reduced by the number of operations performed.
10. The loop continues until either the priority queue is empty or `k` reaches zero.
11. Finally, the calculated result is returned.

# Complexity - 

**Time Complexity:**

1. The `calculateScore` function iterates through the prime factors of a number, which takes O(sqrt(number)) time.
2. The `calculatePower` function uses the exponentiation by squaring technique, which requires O(log(exponent)) operations.
3. Constructing the priority queue and the `list` takes O(n * log n) time due to sorting and insertion into the priority queue.
4. The outer `while` loop runs as long as the priority queue is not empty and `k` is greater than 0. In the worst case, this loop can run up to `n` times.
5. The inner `while` loops for calculating `right` and `left` values can run at most `n` times in total.
6. The final loop calculates the result by multiplying powers, which takes O(n) time.

The overall time complexity of the code is dominated by the sorting and priority queue operations and can be approximated as O(n * log n).

**Space Complexity:**

1. The space complexity is determined by the space used for storing intermediate values and data structures.
2. The priority queue, list, and temporary variables used in calculations contribute to the space complexity.
3. The priority queue and list both require O(n) space.
4. Other variables and data structures used within functions occupy constant space.
5. The space complexity is O(n), as it grows linearly with the input size.

**In summary, the code has a time complexity of approximately O(n * log n) and a space complexity of O(n).**
